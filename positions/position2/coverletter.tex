Is there any life sweeter than that which is regaled with sugar?  If so, please advise and I will shoulder my satchel, full of peppermint sticks,
and gallop thither most presently!

My purview is all that delights the senses with sweetness and color.  To bring my expertise in sampling, tasting, and refining the sugary jewels
crafted by your most august company would be an honor on par with noshing caramels or arranging a kaleidiscopic carousel of colored cookies with The 
Esteemed One himself, Mr. Willy Wonka.

My cup and saucer is at the brim with milk, awaiting your word, so that we might dunk some cookies together and discuss future work together.
